        <h1>Artist paint with brushes, coders paint with a keyword.</h1>

        <p>We often look at coding as something very technical, but there is way more right brain at use than what meets the eye. Your code editor whether it be sublime or a fullblown IDE like intellij, is essentially a blank canvas with limitless possibilities. Key after key and tab after tab it starts to become something more. That is why coding is one the most rewarding skills you will ever have. Still need convincing?, keep scrolling and find out what other benefits being a programmer can have.</p>

    <h2 >What can be built with programming?</h2>
    <img class ="img-class" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uIa6MZHwCdI/VfnQvDo2LwI/AAAAAAAAATA/-p0ZJTSprXI/s1600/socialtest-750x400.jpg"/>
    <p>We benefit from programming in just about everything we do in our daily life. Do you like to go on facebook and scroll down your timeline and look a what your friends are doing, programming made that possible.
        What about going on instagram and posting pics just for the double tap, again thank programming for that.How many hours have you spent playing candy crush saga, most like to many to count. These things are all possible if you have the right skills, Who knows you could build the next big thing.</p>
    <h2>What are programming jobs like? </h2>
    <img class="img_class" src="https://cake.hr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/0db500f1ea897c5cf37e9690dbc92bd9-650x490.jpg"/>
    <p>You may have worked a wide array of jobs in your life, but programming jobs offer some of the most unique work environments. Some jobs you show up to in basketball shorts and a t-shirt. Some provide free food all day long, along with drinks. There are places where every wall in the building is a dry erase board, that makes problem solving at the drop of a dime a breeze. If you're looking for something different than the traditional 9 to 5, give programming a try.</p>
    <h2>How much money can you make?</h2>
    <img class="img_class" src="http://cdn4.tech.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-most-valuable-programming-skills-to-have-on-a-resume-average-salary-value-of-skill_chartbuilder-1.png"/>
    <p> I believe it's good to be in a career that allows you to constantly advance and increase salary. Programming offers just that with a median salary coming in around 84,000 based off statistics in 2015. There is always a new framework or technology you can learn to make you more viable as a programmer. If you are one with entrepeneur aspirations like myself, billionaires have been created with this skillset.</p>
    <h2>What fields can you go into?</h2>
    <img class="img_class" src="http://bknation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bknation_dreamjob.jpg.jpg"/>
    <p>There are not too may fields I can think of off hand that don't require some form of programming. You want to be in the sports field, they require programming of apps and websites. They rely on constant updating of applications to keep pace with the action. If you wanted to get into the acting or the movie industry, get a programming job, and use thay as your segway into something else. Jim mckelvy said "Programming is your ticket into any field", and I truly believe every word of it. Talk about 0 to 60 real quick, your situation can change just like that. </p>
    <h2>How is Launch Code helping aspiring programmers?</h2>
    <img class="img_class" src="http://newsroom.mastercard.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/a-nod-lashana.png"/>
    <p> Launchcode is a non- for profit organization who saw the need for computer programmers at companies in st.louis, but the lack of available candidates sparked the swift action launchcode to help the cause. They went to a 100 HR departments at various companies and asked if they could get them the talent, would they try the candidates out. All the companies agreed and that was the start of what has grown today into an inniative that President Obama endorsed. They offer classes to people with no programming experience looking to get into the field. They pair you up with companies your skills are suitable for, and your interview for a paid intership. It's the best thing since color tv. With all the resources they provide, there are no barriers to entry.</p>
